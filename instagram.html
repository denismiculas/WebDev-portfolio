        <ul class="sapplist">
            

        
            <li class="sappcontent">You can set up a class groupchat where students and lecturers can ask question, answer questions update students with deadlines and so on. Istagram and social media apps in general make it very fast and easy to communicate with friends which is one reason I thing this app is very useful as a teaching and learning tool.</li>
            
    
            
            <li class="sappcontent">Instagram is very useful as our course is heavily based on designs, images and videos which means we can all post our work on instagram by setting up an account for just college to both build a digital portfolio and use it to show both your class mates and lecturers. By doing this, it is very easy to see your progress throughout college as it is all in order, starting with the most recent post to the oldest. You also don't need to worry about misplacing files.</li>
            

            
            <li class="sappcontent">As a designer, photographer, videographer/film maker animator and so on, instagram can be very helpful in terms on finding inspiration. On instagram you can search up hashtags which makes it very easy to find different themed posts. For example if you have an assignment on product photography. You can search up "#productphotography" and many posts will show up.</li>
